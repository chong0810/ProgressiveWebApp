##About / Synopsis
What is it, what does it do?
This is a web application that will allow you do your budget tracking for when you are offline and online

You can add all of your transactions and deposits with or without a connection and be able to see the amount used

##User Story
I like to travel to the beach often near the coast. However I need to keep a sharp eye on my finances. I need to be able to track all incoming and outgoing transactions even if I am not a internet connection.

##Usage
This app will help you keep track all of your money. It's important to know how much is in your account so you dont cause yourself to have any overdraft fees or declined transactions!
